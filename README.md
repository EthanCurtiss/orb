# Orb system

Orbs are listening devices, often located near metaboards, that people can attach themselves to as listeners so that they continue to hear a talk while elsewhere in the world. They also serve as recording devices for audio and video.

You can access the public [test server](https://www.roblox.com/games/8369549984/Orb-test) and watch some videos:

## Usage

Here's a scenario: two masters students graduated from the same University, have similar interests, but haven't seen each other in a while and have moved to different continents since then. They show up for a metauni day session (maybe Foundations) and while wandering around to sit on a floating ring while listening through an orb, they notice each other and disconnect from listening in order to chat about what they're working on now. An hour later they're still talking math, not even noticing that the event ended.

In this scenario the ability to wander off in listener mode **lowers the activation energy for informal social interaction around mathematics**. I think people are much less likely to break out their personal boards and start chatting in the middle of the talk venue, because it feels kinda rude and they might be in the way. But off in some cave or corner of the world it feels OK.

Lowering this activation energy seems important, and is the main purpose of the Orbs.

## Installation
